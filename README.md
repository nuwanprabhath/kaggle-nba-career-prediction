Kaggle-NBA-Career-Prediction
==============================

**Purpose

To predict if a rookie player will last at least 5 years in the league based on their stats. Model training for predicting the 5-Year Career Longevity for NBA Rookies is based on data where:

- y = 0 if career years played < 5
- y = 1 if career years played >= 5

### How to run this model

Setting up the environment
------------
1. Please put test.csv and train.csv inside /data/raw from the Kaggle competition 
2. Install dependencies in the requirements.txt. You can use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Activate your virtual environment (if you have one). For pipenv you can use `pipenv shell`
5. Install Hyperopt-sklearn (if required unless installed in step 2)
   1. `git clone https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt-sklearn.git`
   2. `cd hyperopt-sklearn`
   3. `pip install -e .`
6. Run Jupyter notebook using the root project directory `jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=<directory_name>`
